# Linear-Regression-Challenge
A response to Siraj's Linear Regression model challenge found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOppzHpvTiQ and here: https://github.com/llSourcell/linear_regression_demo

When you are trying to find the best reqression, you must find the line there minimize the sum of squared errors

Here is the plot with all data points and the regression line

Regression line is defined by: f(x) = 1.19303364419x + -3.89578087831



The avage error is 2.19424539883 units

I have made a bar chart so it can be easier to see how the error is distributed
