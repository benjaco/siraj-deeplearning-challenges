# Image classifier Challenge
A response to Siraj's Image classifier Challenge found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAICT4Al5Ow

I have just used the demo code, except for
- I have added 2 new Convolution2D
- I am using 10000 examples in each class, and 2500 for validation

I tried with 30 epochs, but the result was going down after 22 epochs, and all the way down to 50% after 30 epochs (strange?)

I managed to get a accuracy on 84% compared to yours 70%

I setup tensorflow to run on my gpu for this challenge
